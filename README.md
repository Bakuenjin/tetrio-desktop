# [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io/) Desktop
This is just the [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io/) website opened from electron to have a standalone game with limited rich presence capabilities.

### Using the packed binaries (Windows 64-bit only currently)
Just head over to the [release tab](https://github.com/Bakuenjin/tetrio-desktop/releases) and download the latest version.
You can either use the installer or the unpacked app, which works "portable" (no install required, but still saves data locally in appdata).

### Build it yourself
1. Clone this repository
2. Install all dependencies via `yarn` (recommended) or `npm i`
3. Build the app via `yarn dist` (recommended) or `npm run dist`

You could also run this in development via `yarn start` or `npm start`. This requires electron to be installed globally (`yarn global add electron` or `npm i -g electron`)
